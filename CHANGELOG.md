# Changelog

## 2.5.0

- It is now possible to download files within the plugins using
  `haxroomie.download({ file: Blob, fileName: string })` and
  HaxBall recs using `haxroomie.downloadRec({ rec: Uint8Array, fileName: string })`.
- Log timestamps use ISO-8601 format.
- Improved the deserialization of log messages from browser.
  It should now be possible to log objects, strings and
  errors with console.log, console.warn and console.error.
- Fixed `reload` command possibly missing some settings 
  (and same with `RoomController.plugins.setPluginConfig()`).
- Running HHM version 1.0.2 and `saviola777/hhm-plugins` c8ee22cd46d38f4fa8ec29f201755a08ed5dc4a2.

### haxroomie-cli

- Added command line argument `--loglevel` 
  that can be used to set the level of logging. The default
  is `warn` and possible values are `error`, `warn` and `info`.
  For e.g. if loglevel is set to `info` the cli will print
  console.log, console.warn and console.error messages.
- It should be now possible to get the newest versions of plugins
  using the `reload` command in CLI. No need to restart the rooms to update
  plugins anymore.
- Added command line argument `--chromium-args` to pass arguments to the
  browser haxroomie starts.
- Added command line argument `--download-directory` for setting the download
  location for files.

### haxroomie-core

- Added `RoomController.plugins.reloadPlugin()` to be able to reload plugins
  from a repository.
- `Haxroomie` constructor accepts `chromiumArgs` argument for setting additional
  arguments for the browser.
- `Haxroomie` constructor accepts `downloadDirectory` for setting the download
  location for files.

## 2.4.0

### Potentially breaking changes

The new installer creates a global startup script called `haxroomie`.
This name overlaps with the old haxroomie-cli command.

If you already have haxroomie installed and want to use the new installation script
it is preferable to uninstall the old version first with

```
npm uninstall haxroomie-cli -g
```

or rename the `haxroomie` command into `haxroomie-cli`.

### haxroomie-cli

- Easier installation with a script
- Automatically starts haxroomie in tmux session if installed using the
  installation script. There is now also a `min` command when haxroomie
  is running to detach from the tmux session. This helps new users
  so they do not have to bother learning `screen` or `tmux`.

### 2.3.1

#### haxroomie-cli

- Fixed `--no-sandbox` command line option

### 2.3.0

#### haxroomie-cli

- Fixed `players` command displaying wrong amount of players
- Reintroduced `eval` command

#### haxroomie-core

- Added `--disable-features=WebRtcHideLocalIpsWithMdns` to fix connection problems with chrome versions 78 or greater. See https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Headless-Host#connectivity-warning.

#### 2.2.1

##### haxroomie-cli

- Fixed config skeleton path that prevented haxroomie-cli running for the first time if ~/.haxroomie/config.js did not exist.

### 2.2.0

- Added `executablePath` to `Haxroomie` constructor and `--executablePath` to
  `haxroomie-cli` to be able to set the path to chrome/chromium executable.

#### haxroomie-cli

- Fixed `rooms` command player count.
- Use `sendAnnouncement` instead of `sendChat` with `chat` command so it works
  without a host player.

### 2.1.0

  `defaultRepositoryVersion` property.

#### haxroomie-core

## 2.0.0

### Potentially breaking changes

- The 2.0.0 version splits the `haxroomie` package into 2 packages called `haxroomie-core` (API) and `haxroomie-cli` (Command Line Interface). The `haxroomie` npm package will be deprecated.

#### haxroomie-core

- Repository related methods are now organized under `RoomController.repositories`.
- Plugin related methods are now organized under `RoomController.plugins`.
- `RoomController.openRoom(config)` can throw `RoomIsRunningError` if called on
  room that is already running.
- RoomController `close-room` event got split into two events called
  `close-room-start` and `close-room-stop`.
- RoomController `open-room-error` event was merged to `open-room-stop` and removed.
- RoomController `open-room-start`, `open-room-start`, `close-room-start` and `close-room-stop`
  events send the error as first argument if one happens.

### New Features

- Support `noPlayer` option (run rooms without host player).
- Ability to load and remove plugins while room is running.

#### haxroomie-cli

- The commands in CLI are organized into categories.
- Commands that are not usable when selected room is not running are now hidden.
- Commands that require a plugin are hidden if plugin is not loaded and enabled.
- New `init` command that reinitializes the room if it goes to a unusable state.

#### haxroomie-core

- Ability to get repository information before opening a room with
  `RoomController.repositories.getRepositoryInformation(repository)`.
- Support the new HHM `repository.json` definiton for faster loading
  times.

### Fixed Bugs

#### haxroomie-cli

- Can now close haxroomie by pressing ctrl-c or ctrl-d.
- Exit the app when starting if its already running.

#### haxroomie-core

- Fixed race condition that happened when adding multiple rooms into haxroomie
  "simultaniously". The rooms might have got the same page to control.
- Fixed loading of local repositories in windows.
- Starting of room should now fail immediately if hhm cannot be loaded.

#### 1.1.3

- Fixed `unban` command in CLI.

#### 1.1.2

- Fixed CLI commands that were not working.

#### 1.1.1

- Updated the lodash dependency due security vulnerability.

### 1.1.0

#### Potentially breaking changes

- Haxroomie is now released to `npm` and installing with git is no longer recommended.
- Config is now loaded from `~/.haxroomie/config.js` by default. If `~/.haxroomie/config.js` does not exist, one is created from an example config.
- The `user-data-dir` is now loaded from `~/.haxroomie/user-data-dir` by default. Copy your `user-data-dir` there or use the `-d` argument for haxroomie if you have some data you do not want to loose.
- The `banlist` command is now hidden in CLI unless you load the `hr/kickban` plugin from [my plugin repository](https://github.com/morko/hhm-sala-plugins) (also the `!kick`, `!ban` and `!banlist` commands in the room won't exist if this plugin is not loaded)
- In API the `RoomController.openRoom` method now throws an Error if it fails to open the room.
- The API of `RoomController` has changed so that now the methods can throw bunch of custom errors for better error handling. Please review the new API at [documentation website](https://morko.github.io/haxroomie/RoomController.html).

\* _`~` is a shorthand for users home directory in Linux_

#### Migration guide from 1.0.x => 1.1.0

1. Copy your config to `~/.haxroomie/config.js`.
2. Copy the `user-data-dir` in the `haxroomie` folder to `~/.haxroomie/user-data-dir`.
3. Follow installatin instructions in [README](https://github.com/morko/haxroomie#installation)

#### New features (CLI)

- Can now "hot load" the config using `reload` command if only `pluginConfig` is changed. This means that you can change the plugin configurations without restarting the room.
- The `plugins` option "overrides" the `pluginConfig` so that plugins will get loaded from the filesystem if both options contain the same plugin. The configurations in `pluginConfig` now affect the `plugins` loaded from filesystem.
- Can use `roomScript` with `plugins`.
- users can now give the token in the config file using `token` option
- when opening rooms the token will be reused until it becomes invalid
- `reload` command now gives better user feedback
- users can now also use plugins with the `roomScript` option
  - only the default plugins will be disabled
- tried to elaborate what is a room id in `help`
- support using `.env` file in projects root directory to be able to set environment variables

#### Fixed bugs (CLI)
